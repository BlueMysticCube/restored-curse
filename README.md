# restored-curse
Restoration and enhancement of [Jusey1's 'Cursed Difficulty'](https://github.com/Jusey1/Cursed) Minecraft mod for 1.20.1.

The source code of the 1.20.1 version of Cursed Difficulty 1.5.0 (Forge) was recovered from the JAR and refactored.
The following features were added:
 - Command `/curse [<target>]` to curse a player
 - Command `/bless [<target>]` to remove the curse of a player
 - Command `/iscursed [<target>]` to find out if a player is cursed
 - Data-driven extra drops

Currently, only en_us is supported.
All other features should be almost identical to the previous version 1.5.0.
